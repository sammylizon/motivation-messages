# Motivation Messages
A random message generator. It tells; 
1. An inspirational quote 
2. A fact about success 
3. A tip on how to achieve success

## From developer 
This is a small piece of code I have created to test out my knowledge of Git and Github. I have added 'Issues' which are suggestions to expand on the variety of each message. 
There is still work to do on this code to potentially make it cleaner and also expand on the current concept. For example a 'Welcome messsage' that says, 'Good Morning' or 'Good Afternoon' depending on the time of the day.
